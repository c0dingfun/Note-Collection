Catalog vs Database vs Schema
====

- Cluster > Catalog > Schema > Table > Columns & Rows

> A database server is a cluster.
> A cluster has catalogs. ( Catalog == Database )
> Catalogs have schemas. (Schema == namespace of tables, and security boundary)
> Schemas have tables.
> Tables have rows.
> Rows have values, defined by columns.
> Those values are the business data your apps and users care about such as person's name, invoice due date, product price, gamerâ€™s high score. The column defines the data type of the values (text, date, number, and so on).
